Swami: District police, IGs (Inspector General) and DIGs (Deputy Inspector General) are coming here for police training programme. Among them, there is a very strong police lady. (Swami was recalling her name. Meanwhile Prof. Anil Kumar mentioned some name) She is from here, but this lady is from Mumbai. 


Teacher: Kiran Bedi, Swami. 


(Ms. Kiran Bedi is the first woman officer in the Indian Police Service (IPS) and holds the post of Director General at the Bureau of Police Research and Development).

Swami: Yes, Kiran Bedi. She has got a very good name. She is also coming. 


Teacher: Swami, she was in-charge of prisons and did many good things. (Swami praised her.) 


Teacher 2: She was also called ‘Crane’ Bedi because like a crane she removed people who were problematic. (Swami agreed.) 


Swami: I am busy. I came at 2 o’clock in the afternoon. (Mentioning a devotee’s name) He has to catch the 5 o’clock flight from Bangalore and wanted to go early, therefore I came early. 


Prof. A. K.: Swami always sees to it that others convenience is taken care. 


Swami: Yes, I always see to it that things are convenient for others. 


Then Swami went back to interview room.
